# Random Imgur Images
Show random images from Imgur. Generates random 5-character strings until an image on imgur.com is found and repeats the process until it finds 120 images. You should expect some of the content it finds to be NSFW.

[Demo here](https://donwilson.github.io/random-imgur-images/index.html)

I didn't create the original version of this script but I have cleaned it up a bit.
